        <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            Our services employ cookies, web beacons, mobile analytics, advertising IDs, and other similar technologies for operational purposes and data collection, including device identifiers, usage statistics, and device data. Cookies, small data files sent to
            your computer's hard drive by a website, assist in enhancing your online experience. We use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until removed, to offer a tailored
            and engaging experience on our website. Cookies typically contain a unique alphanumeric identifier for your device, but may include additional data as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our websites feature web beacons (also known as single-pixel gifs), electronic images that aid in cookie delivery, count website visitors, and compile performance data. We incorporate web beacons in our promotional emails and newsletters to track if they
            are opened and interacted with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mobile analytics and advertising IDs, created by mobile operating systems like iOS and Android, are utilized by apps in a similar manner to how websites use cookies. Our applications include software allowing third-party analytics and advertising partners
            to access these mobile IDs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We and our third-party partners use these technologies to gather personal information (such as browser cookies, mobile device advertising IDs, and your device's IP address) when you use our Services. This technology also helps us and our partners collect
            data about your online activities across various websites over time. The information gathered is used for multiple purposes: to remember your preferences and settings, facilitate sign-in, provide targeted advertising, prevent fraud, analyze
            service performance, track your interactions with our Services, develop insights, and other legitimate functions. This collected or inferred information is also shared with third parties for similar purposes.

            We allow third-party internet advertising firms, often known as ad networks or network advertisers, to present you with advertisements. These entities might employ various technologies such as cookies, web beacons, device identifiers specific to platforms,
            software agents, and more to gather non-personal data about your activities across our Service and other websites over time. This information aids them in providing ads tailored to your interests, evaluating the effectiveness of these ads,
            customizing the advertising content, and understanding your use of our Services and other sites tracked by these advertising companies. We do not have control over or access to the cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, software agents,
            or other technologies these companies use. Additionally, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party advertisers. You should review the privacy policy of each third-party advertiser to understand how they separately
            collect and handle your information.
        </p>

        <p>
            For information about these third parties' privacy practices and to opt out of their cookie usage for targeted advertising, you can follow the provided links.

        <h3>California “Do Not Sell My Info”</h3>
        <p>
            Under the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), Alternative Medicine News is required to inform you about the categories of personal data that are sold to third parties and provide guidance on opting out of future sales. According to the CCPA,
            personal information encompasses online identifiers, which include IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs. The law interprets a “sale” as making data available to third parties in some instances. At Alternative Medicine News, we allow advertising
            and analytics providers to collect your IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs via our websites and apps when you utilize our online services, but we do not engage in the “sale” of any other types of personal information. If you prefer that
            Alternative Medicine News and our partners do not “sell” your personal data for advertising purposes, you can submit a Do Not Sell Request by emailing alternativemedicineweekly@gmail.com Please note, even after we receive your request, we
            might still share some personal information with our partners (acting as service providers) to assist with advertising tasks such as measuring ad effectiveness, controlling ad frequency, reporting on ad performance, ensuring service functionality
            and security, providing aggregated statistics and analytics, optimizing ad placement, and reducing ad fraud. Emailing us does not automatically opt you out of the utilization of previously sold personal information or halt all interest-based
            advertising. Additionally, if you use other devices or browsers, you should visit the link provided below through those devices or browsers to ensure your choices are applied to the data collected through them. Further details about your rights
            to opt out of personal data sales are included in the California Privacy Rights section of this Notice.

        <h3>Cookie Management</h3>
        <p>Typically, web browsers accept cookies by default. You can alter your browser settings to delete or reject cookies. However, doing so might impact certain website features or services. Deleting cookies may also remove settings and preferences
            governed by those cookies, including advertising preferences, which may need to be reset.</p>

        <h3>Mobile Advertising ID Management</h3>
        <p> The operating systems for iOS and Android offer options to limit tracking and reset advertising IDs.</p>

        <h3>Email Web Beacons</h3>
        <p>You can modify your email client settings to prevent the automatic downloading of images, disabling web beacons in the emails you read.</p>

        <h3>Do Not Track Settings</h3>
        <p>Some browsers feature “Do Not Track” (DNT) settings that send a signal to websites indicating your preference not to be tracked. However, as there is no universally accepted method for interpreting DNT signals, our websites currently do not respond
            to browser DNT signals. You can instead use various tools for controlling data collection and use, including the cookie and advertising controls mentioned above. </p>


        <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>Alternative Medicine News implements a variety of security measures aimed at safeguarding the personal information entrusted to us. This includes, where suitable, the encryption of data in storage and the encryption of information during transmission.
            In instances where Alternative Medicine News relies on third-party providers for data storage and transmission, we utilize the security features these providers offer to secure personal information. Beyond leveraging security tools provided
            by third-party providers, Alternative Medicine News takes reasonable and appropriate actions to help shield your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or disclosure. It's important to recognize that no company can entirely eliminate
            security risks. While Alternative Medicine News is dedicated to protecting your personal data, we cannot assure its complete security. As an added precaution, we encourage you to use a unique password for our Services that you do not employ
            for other websites or online services, enhancing the security of your information.
        </p>

        <h3>Sharing of Data</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners,
            trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.</p>

        <h3>Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
        <p>You have certain data protection rights, including the right to access, update, or to delete the information we have on you.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
